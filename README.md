# gmailctl-recruiter-filter

A [gmailctl](https://github.com/mbrt/gmailctl) filter to auto-delete technical recruiter spam I've received over the years.

1. Despite the U.S. Govermentâ€™s defintion of "spam" (e.g., [CAN-SPAM Act (2003)](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business)), my definition of spam includes _unsolicited_ email.

1. This definition is only a _fragment_ of a valid `gmailctl` configuration. You will need to add it to your existing configurations by-hand, with automation, or whatever level of effort you feel like applying.
